## Problem Statement
A corrupt businessman named Xu Yuan challenges Interpol to recover the PIN to his offshore bank account in Luxembourg, after he was confronted in his home. He declared:

> "Right now, my PIN is a pair of positive integers ($x$, $p$), $p$ is a 4-digit prime integer and $x \lt p$. Here is a list of consecuitve powers of $x (\text{mod }p)$: 1021, 7868, 8445, 2967, 45, 6825, 240, 404, 1280, 8154. But it changes every **5 minutes**, so if you miss your window of opportunity, too bad! MUHAHAHAHA!"

Lead Interpol agent Miang Seng immediately whips out his pocket calculator (why does he even bring such things around during arrests), recovers $x$ and $p$ in less that half the time, and transfers Xu Yuan's money into his own offshore bank account in Andorra. How did he do it?
